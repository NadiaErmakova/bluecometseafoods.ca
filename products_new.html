              <h3><a href="tuna.html">Wild Albacore Tuna</a></h3>
<p>Wild Albacore Tuna is noted for its white, firm meat and delicate flavour. They are 3-4 year old fish harvested by hook and line. Tuna can be seared, barbecued, baked, steamed and fried, as well as cured in citrus juice or rolled au naturel in a favourite sushi recipe. Before cooking, tuna should be thoroughly thawed. With a mild taste and a lovely colour that turns from rosy pink to ivory white when cooked. </p>
<p>Nutritionally, British Columbia Albacore Tuna is 100% wild food, high in protein, low in carbohydrates and very high in Omega-3 fatty acids (2.1 grams per 100 grams) and high in total fat (7.2 grams per 100 grams) as well as rich in minerals. They are also packed full of selenium, a heavy-hitting mineral antioxidant that is lacking in most North American diets due to its depletion in the soil by modern agricultural techniques. </p>

			<h3><a href="lingcod.html">Wild Lingcod</a></h3>
           <p>Wild Lingcod is a good source of protein, low in saturated fat with a moist sweet flesh. It is unique to the West coast of North America with an abundance off the Coast of British Columbia. A mature lingcod can reach up to 5 feet long and has a distinct large mouth and numerous sharp teeth.   </p>
<p> Lingcod vary in color from grey-brown to green and bluish, with darker spotting and mottling on upper parts. The preferred habitat for lingcod varies depending on age and gender of the fish. Larvae are pelagic both nearshore and offshore. When 8-10 cm long (3 months), juveniles begin to settle in sand, gravel and eelgrass in bays, estuaries and shallow soft bottoms, then at ages one to two years, move to rocky bottom areas. Adults are often found on rocky bottom substrate from the intertidal zone to more than 300 m depth on the continental shelf, but typically prefer 0 to 70 m depth.</p>
<p>Its mild flesh is moist and is often preferred over halibut (total fat 0.6 grams per 100 grams). All sources of lingcod from British Columbia are ranked as “Best Choice”. </p>

              <h3><a href="halibut.html">Pacific Halibut</a></h3>
<p>Pacific halibut is prized for the delicate flavor and firm texture of its sparkling white, almost translucent flesh. The lean white meat of the Pacific halibut is high in protein and
 low in sodium, fat and calories, and with a minimum of bones, halibut as whole fish, fillets or portions adapts well to baking, broiling, frying, poaching or barbecuing.</p>
 <p>Pacific halibut is one of the largest flatfish – they can weigh up to about 500 pounds and grow to over 8 feet long. Males tend to be smaller than females. Halibut are demersal, living on or near the bottom of the water and prefer water temperatures ranging from 3 to 8 degrees Celsius (37.4 to 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>Halibut are strong swimmers and are able to migrate long distances. Halibut of all ages and sizes are involved in a predominantly clockwise (northwest to southeast) migration from their settlement areas, reproductive fish also make regular seasonal migrations from more shallow feeding grounds in summer to deeper spawning grounds in winter.</p>
