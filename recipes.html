              <img src="images/lingcod_1.jpg" class="img_right_gallery" title="Lingcod" width="210">

              <p> <i>2 12 oz lingcod fillets, cut into 3 oz portions, 350 mL Wild Rose Electric Avenue Golden Lager, 375 mL tempura flour, canola oil for frying, coleslaw for serving.</i></p>

              <p> For the batter, mix the tempura flour and beer with a wire whisk. Heat 1 litre of oil in a Dutch oven until a drop of batter sizzles and crisps right away.
Pat the fish dry with paper towel, then dredge in flour. Shake off excess, then dip in the beer batter. Carefully lower each portion into the hot oil and fry for 6-8 minutes (depending on thickness) until golden and crispy. Using a large slotted spoon, lift out the fish, drain on paper towel and sprinkle with salt. <br/><br/>
Coleslaw : While frying the fish, in a medium size bowl whisk mayo, sour cream, white sugar, malt vinegar and lemon juice. Add the remaining ingredients and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

             <img src="images/lingcod_2.jpg" class="img_right_gallery" title="Lingcod" width="210">   
               <p><i>18 1 ½ oz slices fresh lingcod, tempura batter, 2 L canola or vegetable oil, 18 fresh whole corn tortillas, 1 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese, ½ heads green cabbage, fresh tomato salsa, avo-tillo Sauce, chipotle mayo, 1 bunch cilantro, 6 limes. </i></p>
               <p>Avo-tillo Sauce: Pour vegetable oil into a large saucepan and sauté onions, jalapeno pepper, and garlic until the onions are soft and translucent. Add coriander and cumin and toast for half a minute. Add tomatillos, white vinegar, lime juice, and sugar, and let simmer until tomatoes are just soft. Add avocados and puree with blender until smooth then add salt and pepper to taste. Chill and reserve for tacos. <br/><br/>
Fish Taco Assembly: Fill deep fryer or a large pot with canola or vegetable oil and heat oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (Only use enough to float the fish strips in if you are using a pot). Dip lingcod into tempura batter. One-by-one, add lingcod slowly to the hot oil so they form a quick crust and do not stick to the bottom or each other (only cook a few pieces of cod at a time). Once the outside crust is golden brown and fish is floating, approximately two minutes, remove and place on paper towel or a metal rack to dry on. In a hot skillet warm corn tortillas until lightly toasted and soft. Fill corn tortillas with cheese, shredded cabbage, avo-tillo auce, and chipotle mayo. Top with tempura fried lingcod and fresh tomato salsa. Garnish with fresh cilantro sprigs and lime wedge. </p>

			 <img src="images/halibut_1.jpg" class="img_right_gallery" title="Halibut" width="210">
              <p><i> 4 pieces skinless halibut fillet, each fillet about 6-ounces/170 grams), coarse salt and freshly cracked black pepper, 1 Tbsp fresh thyme, grated zest of 1 lime, 2 tbsp olive oil (30 ml), lime wedges, 1 bunch watercress. 1 ½ cup grape tomatoes, cut in half (375 ml), 12 red pearl onions, blanched and peeled splash of olive oil, grated zest and juice of 1 lime, for salsa. </i></p>
              <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. For the roasted tomato salsa: add a splash of olive oil, tomatoes, pearl onions, grated zest and juice of lime, and thyme sprigs to a medium roasting pan. Season the tomatoes with salt and pepper. Roast in oven just until onions and tomatoes start to soften, about 7 to 10 minutes. 
Meanwhile season fish with salt and pepper, zest from 1 lime and chopped thyme. Add 2 tbsp. olive oil to large skillet or sauté pan over medium high heat. When pan is hot, sear fish on both sides, about 1 to 2 minute per side. 
Transfer halibut to roasting pan after vegetables have roasted for about 7 to 10 minutes. Roast fish with vegetables, moving vegetables in the pan to surround the fish. Continue to roast until fish is cooked through and firm, about 7 to 9 minutes. <br/><br/>
Serve fish and roasted salsa with fresh watercress. Drizzle each plate with some of the pan juices.

                  <h3>Halibut with Brown Butter, Crushed Chickpeas with Olives and Roasted Cumin Carrots </h3>

               <p><i> ½ cup unsalted butter, lemon juice, 2 Tbsp olive oil, 4 halibut filets, about 4 ounces/110 g each, 1 pinch salt and pepper. Carrots: 8 slender carrots, Olive oil, for drizzling, 2 tsp cumin seed, lightly crushed, Salt and pepper. Chick Peas: 1 cup chickpeas, 1 onion, 1 bay leaf, 3 Tbsp olive oil, 2 clove garlic, minced, Salt and pepper, ½ cup green olives, pitted, handful chopped parsley, Juice and zest of a lemon.</i></p>
               
                      <p>Halibut: Melt the butter and cook until lightly brown and foaming. Add a squeeze of lemon juice, and set aside. Heat the oil in a frying pan. Season the fish on both sides, lay in the pan and fry four minutes. Flip, and cover to finish, four to six minutes. Serve with some brown butter dribbled over. Spoon a small pile of the crushed chickpeas and olives on the plate. Add the fish to the plate and top with roasted carrots.<br/><br/>
Carrots: Heat oven to 400°F/200°C. Slice the carrots lengthwise, leaving a bit of green top attached, for looks. Toss on a baking sheet with the olive oil, crushed cumin seed, salt and pepper. Roast until tender and golden-edged, about 30 minutes, depending on their size. They should be slightly crinkly and golden-edged.<br/><br/>
Chick Peas: Soak the chick peas in a bowl of cold water over night. Drain and rinse, then put in a pot with the onion and bay leaf. Cover, just, with water. Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, until very tender, about 45 minutes. Drain, discarding the onion and bay leaf. Heat the oil in a sauté pan and gently fry the garlic, 30 seconds. Add the chickpeas, salt, and pepper, to heat through. Crush a bit, here and there, with a potato masher, leaving some chick peas whole. Remove from the heat and stir in the olives, parsley, and lemon zest. Add lemon juice to taste. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, and serve as a base for fish. </p>

              <img src="images/halibut_2.jpg" class="img_right_gallery" title="Halibut" width="210">   
               <p><i> 4 (6-oz/170 g) fresh halibut, at least 3/4-inch thick, 2 cups (500 mL) + 1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil, salt and white pepper, 2 Tbsp (30 mL) chopped fresh parsley, 1 tbsp (15 mL) chopped fresh chives, mint-cucumber gazpacho, chipotle aioli, chipotle potato salad for serving.</i></p>
                      <p>Mint-Cucumber Gazpacho: Peel the cucumbers, slice in half lengthwise and remove seeds. Peel and core apple. In a food processor, purée cucumber, apple garlic, white wine vinegar and honey. While mixing, slowly pour in olive oil. Check seasoning and transfer to a serving bowl (or container that fits in your fridge). Fold mint chiffonade into the finished gazpacho and chill. <br/><br/>
Chipotle Aioli: Combine chipotles, adobo, ketchup, honey, oregano, ground cumin, paprika and sherry vinegar in a food processor. Blend until well combined. Slowly add extra virgin olive and continue to blend. Adjust seasoning. Add the mixture to lemon aioli. Whisk until well incorporated, and refrigerate. <br/>
Chipotle Potato Salad: Preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C). Cut the potatoes into bite-size pieces. Toss the potatoes with vegetable oil and salt and roast in the oven on a shallow baking tray lined with parchment paper. Using a peeler, shave the carrot down to the core, lengthwise. Thinly shave fennel and red onion (ideally using a mandolin). Combine 2 Tbsp (30 mL) chipotle aioli, and all ingredients in a bowl and season with salt. <br/><br/>
Olive-Oil Poached Ocean Wise Halibut with Herb Crust: Let the fish sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Add 2 cups oil to a pan large enough to submerge fillets in the oil. Heat the oil to 90°F (32°C). Season the fish with salt and white pepper. Gently rub fish with the remaining olive oil, to better adhere herbs to it. Mix parsley and chives and apply one side of the fish with them. In another pan, sear the fish with the herb-side down (to create an herb crust). Gently remove the fish with a fish spatula and place it in the olive oil pan. 
Poach over low heat for 25 minutes. Remove from the olive-oil bath and adjust seasoning. <br/><br/>
To Serve: Pour the gazpacho into four shallow bowls. Place the potato salad in the centre of shallow bowls, followed by the cooked fish. To garnish, use a salad of watercress, frisee or micro greens. </p>

               <h3>Grilled Halibut with Tomato Vinaigrette</h3>
               <p><i> 6 5 oz halibut fillet portions, olive oil, for brushing, salt and pepper, 1 bunch fresh thyme sprigs, ½ cup fresh basil leaves, loosely packed. Tomato Vinaigrette : 2 ripe beefsteak tomatoes, ¼ cup tomato vinegar (or good quality white wine vinegar), 1 tsp minced garlic, 2 Tbsp minced red onion, ¼ cup good quality extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper. </i></p>
                    <p>Tomato Vinaigrette: Mark tomatoes with an “x” at the bottom and blanch for 1 minute in boiling water. Shock tomatoes in ice water, then peel off skins (saving them). Seed tomatoes (saving the seeds, too) and finely diced the tomato.
Stir vinegar and garlic with half of diced tomato and saved skins and seeds. Let sit for 30 minutes then strain through a cheesecloth without squeezing (to keep liquid clear).
Dispose of tomatoes (or cook into your next pasta dish). Whisk red onion into vinegar and slowly drizzle in oil. Stir in remaining diced tomato and season to taste. Whisk before using.<br/><br/>
Grilled Halibut: Preheat grill on medium high and heat a fish grill (mesh). Brush halibut fillets with oil and season lightly.
Place thyme on grill and once it starts smoking, place halibut fillets on grill. Close lid on BBQ and let cook for 8 minutes.
Lift lid and turn halibut 90 degrees and close lid. Cook fish 8 minutes more, until it flakes easily when touched with a fork. Remove halibut and serve with tomato vinaigrette. Tear basil leaves over immediately before serve.

              <img src="images/sablefish_2.jpg" class="img_right_gallery" title="Sablefish" width="210">             
              <p><i> 1 piece (150 g) sablefish, 2 piece baby leeks, 1 small watermelon radish, cut into 1 cm square cubes, 1 medium shiitake mushroom, 40 g chicken, 1 egg white, 100 g panko breadcrumbs, 1 whole egg, 2 tbsp all-purpose flour. </i></p>

             <img src="images/sablefish_1.jpg" class="img_right_gallery" title="Sablefish" width="210">   
               <p><i> 4 fillets sablefish, 6-oz each, skin on, 1 ½ cup Soy-Sake Marinade, 10 oz green beans, 2 Tbsp unsalted butter, 2 cup canola oil for deep-frying, 4 Tbsp flour, pinch cayenne pepper, 4 shallots, thinly sliced on a mandolin, soy-sake marinade, orange-tamarind sause.</i></p>
            <p>Soy-Sake Marinade: In a small saucepan, bring all ingredients to a boil on high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-high and simmer until sugar is dissolved and alcohol has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, allow the mixture to cool, then refrigerate until well chilled. <br/><br/>
Orange-Tamarind Sauce: In a large saucepan, heat olive oil on medium heat. Add carrot, celery, onion, garlic, jalapen~o and ginger and sweat for 5 to 10 minutes until fragrant. 
Add mustard seeds, peppercorns, thyme, bay leaf, vinegar, orange juice, tamarind paste and chicken stock and cook until liquid has reduced by two-thirds, 20 to 30 minutes. 
Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl, then season with salt and pepper. Add kumquats. Will keep refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 7 days. <br/><br/>
Caramelized Sablefish: Combine sablefish and soy-sake marinade in a resealable plastic zip-top bag and refrigerate overnight. Heat a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add beans and blanch for 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the beans to a bowl and toss in butter. Season with salt and pepper. Heat canola oil in a deep fryer or a deep pot to 300 f. Mix flour and cayenne in a bowl. Toss shallot slices in this seasoned flour to dredge, then fry them in the oil until golden and crisp, about 30 seconds. Remove the shallot slices from the oil and allow to drain on paper towels. Remove the sablefish fillets from the refrigerator and allow them to warm to room temperature. Turn the broiler on. Transfer the sablefish, skin-side down, to a cast- iron pan and place it on the lowest rack under the broiler for 5 to 10 minutes until deeply caramelized. (The cooking time will depend upon the thickness of the fillets.) 
To serve: Arrange a quarter of the green beans in the centre of each of four plates. Using a metal spatula, lift each fillet from its skin and place the fish on the beans. Sprinkle each dish with a quarter of the fried shallots and finish with a quarter of the orange- tamarind sauce and some orange zest. </p>
